// *** allConstruct Problem *** 

// Write a function 'allConstruct(target, wordBank)' that accepts a target string and an array of strings.

// The function should return a 2D array containing ~!*all of the ways*!~ that the 'target' can be constructed by concatenating elements of the 'wordBank' array. Each element of the 2D array should represent one combination that constructs the 'target'.

// Notes: 2D array means an outer array(representing the collection) and a sub array(representing the exact way(s) to create the target).

// You may resuse elements of 'wordBank' as many times as needed.

const allConstruct = (target, wordBank) => {
    if ()
}
